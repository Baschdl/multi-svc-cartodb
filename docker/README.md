The directories here act as contexts for each of the individual services lauched by running `docker-compose up` in the root of the repository. Each service directory contains at least a Dockerfile, and may contain additional assets like configuration files, scripts, and Docker hooks.

For more info about Docker's 'build context' concept see [the documentation for the `docker build` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#extended-description). The tl;dr version is that whenever you build a Docker image, it needs a 'context' (on the host or remotely) in which to search for assets used by commands like `COPY` in the Dockerfile. The context can be set at build time via CLI flags to `docker build`, or in the `docker-compose.yml` file. It is important to note that while you may use paths relative to the context root in a Dockerfile, the build engine cannot look anywhere above the root context directory during a build. Consequently the engine is unable to, for instance, perform `COPY ../somefile /path/on/container`.
