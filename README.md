# Implementation of CartoDB in multiple services

The instructions below are detailed--the [Quickstart is here](./docs/QUICKSTART.md).

## Overview

CartoDB is itself a multi-service application, made up of the following core pieces:

* **CartoDB Builder** - A Ruby on Rails application that provides user and map/data management for organizations on the Carto platform.
* **PostgreSQL/PostGIS, with Carto extension(s)** - Map and user data are principally stored in a number of PostgreSQL databases, which have been extended with both PostGIS, and the extension functions from Carto's own PostgreSQL extension.
* **Redis** - Configuration, state, and authentication data are stored in Redis. The Redis instance is hit both by CartoDB Builder and by the SQL-API and Windshaft tile server instances.
* **Carto SQL API** - A Node.js application responsible for handling passthrough of SQL to the PostgreSQL instance, allowing both public and authenticated requests. Public requests may perform SELECT on a subset of an organization's data, while requests authenticated by a non-public API key may be allowed to actively alter data on the server.
* **Windshaft Map Tile Server** - A Node.js application which serves map tiles based on data held in the PostgreSQL instance, with the Carto SQL API acting as an intermediary.

## Installation

See the instructions in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).
