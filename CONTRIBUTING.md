# Contributing to `multi-svc-cartodb`

Thank you for contributing!

To make everybody's contributions combine into the Voltron of CartoDB builds, here are some guidelines we think will streamline the development process. (Meta sideline--if you've got improvements to these guidelines, absolutely put up a pull request!)

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Everyone is doing their best. (TODO: Replace this with a genuine, actionable CoC.)

## I have a question!

That's awesome! Your best bet is to... (TODO: Add links to FAQs, message board, etc., once they exist.)

For the moment, please file an issue with the `question` label.

## I need help with something!

File an issue with the `help wanted` label!

## I found a bug!

That's also awesome! Good job. To let us know about it most helpfully, you should:

1. Check the following resources, just in case you've found a known issue:
    1. The repository issues queue
    1. TODO: Add further resources.
1. Make sure you've got enough information to really file a solid report, including:
    1. The simplest possible replication conditions
    1. A clear set of state information about your install (like your `.env` file contents, your Docker engine version, etc.)
    1. A description of the expected behavior, and how your deploy is deviating from it
1. Format that stuff up into an issue, and label it with `bug`! 

TODO: Provide more specifics about issue formatting, required state info, etc.

## I think something could be better!

Sweet. If you can file a PR (with a clear description of what you've updated) that's wonderful, but if you just want to file an issue labeled `enhancement`, that's helpful as well. This absolutely includes documentation--if you feel there's something worth clarifying, clarify away.
